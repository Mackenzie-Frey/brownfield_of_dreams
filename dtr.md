Mary Goodhart & Mackenzie Frey

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?</span>**

Mary -

Professional portfolio piece, understand consuming APIs, time for exploration, improve version control

Mackenzie -

Time on keyboard, room to explore ideas, Professional portfolio piece.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Motivation:</span>**

Mary - To have a good portfolio piece and gain better experience working in pairs, learn about APIs and start becoming comfortable with them OATH!!!!

Mackenzie -

Learning ( OAuth and APIs)

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Goals and expectations/ define success:</span>**

Mary - Complete all 3s as well, 4 always nice if timing permits. LEARN cool things about coding!

Mackenzie -

Complete all 3s. 4s as a stretch goal. Goal = learning, finishing to project is a bonus!

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Team strengths:</span>**

Mary - problem solving, organization, trying/exploring new things, acknowledging when stuck and reaching out for help in a timely manner

Mackenzie -

organizational, scheduling, problem solving, isolating code that is making logical jumps, reaching out to resources in a time effective manner, evaluating if current tasks are effective for learning or if we should focus on other things

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to overcome obstacles:</span>**

Mary - Technical: address what is going on, work together to solve, using resources online, reach out to cohort-mates, the mod above, mentors, senior devs.

Team: schedule dtrs in advance, talking when an issue arises, be specific, actionable, and kind

Mackenzie -

Talk about it when it comes up. There is never a perfect time! Schedule DTR's. Technical - outline different paths to take, weigh pros and cons, bring in an expert if we are unable to decide a path to tip the scale.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):</span>**

Mary - I'm always at turing m-f 730-whenever. I have pairing once a week with my mentor for one hour. Open availability on the weekends. I use time before school to work on resumes and things outside the project so that i have time for going over lessons, studying, reviewing, working on other deliverables. I may have other things come up but will always be communicating as soon as i know.

Mackenzie -

I have to make my Lightning Talk this week.

Find time to review lessons before hand.

Happy to come early, as long as I can get to the gym at some point, I'm happy to be flexible with scheduling. Okay to work for lunches. I like to do run club on Mondays/Thursdays during lunch. I like to stop by Brother's on Thursday. Important for me to leave Turing by 7 pm (ideally latest) but can be flexible if we are on a deadline/accomplishing a lot. I work both ways on the train, but it can be too noisy/inconsistent signal for slack calls.

Okay to work all weekend. Prefer to work in person to accelerate troubleshooting. I like to sleep in some on the weekends. Aka earliest I'm usually at Turing is 9 am.

Sunday Feb 3rd, I've committed to a family dinner at 6 pm. Can work until 5:30 pm in person, then after dinner remotely.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?:</span>**

Mary - good communication, internet, mostly any kind of environment is fine except for super loud.

Mackenzie -

Ideally quiet space, unless it is beneficial to be around other team for questions to be answered. Challenging for me to switch spaces, I'm most effective by picking a place and staying there, unless I get antsy (:

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Collaboration Style (pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer):</span>**

Mary - both work for me

Mackenzie -

Happy to evaluate as we go. The cards seem to determine a lot of it.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):</span>**

Mary - daily, I'm nearly always on slack, will turn it on sleep between 10pm-7am

Mackenzie -

Feel free to call / text me, as it tends to get my attention faster than slack. I keep my phone on do not disturb 24-7, but almost always see notifications. Texts and calls almost always appear on my computer.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):</span>**

Mary - Strengths: Deploying on heroku, checking app in production environment, willing to take risks and try new things, TDD, DDD, understanding of MVC

To improve: understanding the world of API (as much as one can), the ability to learn on another person's code base, become more familiar with reading API docs as they are all different it seems

Mackenzie -

I've never deployed to heroku and would like to do that. TDD.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?) & Timeline:</span>**

Mary - Will know tomorrow, have not had a chance to see the project yet.

Mackenzie -

Let's revisit. I'd like to schedule a buffer zone at the end of the project. ( 2 days prior). No later than 1 day prior in order to make sure we have time to go over tests.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):</span>**

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mary - Commit often, always branch, have detailed comments on PRs as well as good overall communication throughout our entire project. Name branches with what feature you work on, underscores not dashes</span>**

Mackenzie -

Diito Mary's

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:</span>**

Mary - I prefer to address problems when they arise; all feedback and communication should be specific actionable and kind

Mackenzie -

Ditto to Mary's

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What's gone well/poorly in previous projects?:</span>**

Mary - Insufficient dtr which led to poor communication and a group member leaving.

Mackenzie -

Expectation set that someone will be available via slack and then they are not. Team members unwilling to explore ideas.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Strategies to Minimize Git Fires:</span>**

Before merging to master, fetch to local before merging and run rspec.

Mackenzie will share bash prompt with Mary so branch name is in prompt.

Always checkout a branch if new changes are made.

When a user story is closed, add the full user story to the PR via copy and paste.

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Agenda to discuss project launch: will each go over everything tonight, project work time tomorrow will be the real start</span>**

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ideas:</span>**

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tools:</span>**

#### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Additional Notes:</span>**

Book Rooms

Cards to Make ->

Schedule deployment, Schedule additional DTR's, final rubric walk through (self eval), quiz each other on 4 pillar of OOP
